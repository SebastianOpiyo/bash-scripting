# Script Naming Convention
 - Always create a directory to store your scripts, be orderly
 - Script name should identify a function/purpose
 - name end with [.shell] if used for multiple shells, otherwise [.bash] for 
   bash shell etc.

# Script File Permissions
 - You need right permission to execute a file. i.e rwx Permissions.
 - e.g rwxr-xr-x where root has full permission, group has xr and other xr
 - to change permission [chmod a+x script-name] where "a" stands for all.
